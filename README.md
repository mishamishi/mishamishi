Hi there 👋

I’m Millie — a former art kid turned Graphic Designer and Illustrator, passionate about storytelling through digital visual media. I’m based in Mexico and currently studying Programming and Digital Transformation.

If you can’t find me reading webtoons at home, I am most likely sketchking at the nearest cafe.
